April 18th -

All requirements done but would like to extend it with the following.

1) upvotes needs a new model by itself

2) when user clicks on upvotes - (not logged in will redirected to login page just like adding a new song)

3) when already upvoted - cannot upvote anymore (button vanishes)

4) everytime upvotes - upvotes db is updated. upvotes is belongs to user and songs (messages)

5) songs sorted in order of upvotes.
